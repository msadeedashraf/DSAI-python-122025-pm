# 🐍 Python Student Assignment — Variables, Conversions, f-Strings & Functions

## 📌 Part 1 — Variables, Data Types & Printing

**Q1.** Create variables for:

- First name  
- Age  
- Country  
- Height (float)  
- Do you like Python? (boolean)  

Print a sentence using an f-string. Example:  
Hi, I am Ahmad from Canada. I am 30 years old and my height is 5.8 feet.

---

**Q2.** Create these variables and print both the value and data type:

x = 12  
y = 7.52  
z = "Python"  
flag = False  

---

## 📌 Part 2 — User Input & Type Conversion

**Q3.** Ask the user for two numbers. Convert them to integers, add them, and print the result using an f-string.

Example: The sum of 10 and 5 is 15.

---

**Q4.** Ask the user for length and width. Convert inputs to integers, calculate the area, and print using formatting:

Area = 20.00 square units

---

## 📌 Part 3 — Formatting With f-Strings

**Q5.** Given:
num1 = 5.678  
num2 = 9.123  

Show both numbers and their sum rounded to 2 decimal places:
The sum of 5.68 and 9.12 is 14.80

---

## 📌 Part 4 — Practical Calculators

### 🔹 Q6. Celsius → Fahrenheit Converter

Ask for temperature in Celsius. Convert using:
F = (C × 9/5) + 32  

Display result with 1 decimal place. Example:  
25°C is 77.0°F

---

### 🔹 Q7. BMI Calculator

Formula:  
BMI = weight / (height²)  

Ask for weight in kg and height in meters. Display BMI rounded to 1 decimal and show category.

---

### 🔹 Q8. Simple Mortgage Payment Calculator

Ask for:
- Loan amount (P)
- Annual interest rate
- Years

Compute:
r = (annual rate / 100) / 12  
n = years * 12  
M = P * (r * (1+r)**n) / ((1+r)**n - 1)

Print monthly payment rounded to 2 decimals.

---

## 📌 Part 5 — Functions

**Q9.** Create and call a function:  
greet(name) → prints:  
Hello <name>, welcome to Python!  
Call it 3+ times.

---

**Q10.** Create a function:  
add_numbers(a, b) → returns sum  
Print result using an f-string.

---

## 🚀 Part 6 — Challenge Section

### ⭐ Q11. Age in Days Calculator

Ask age in years. Convert to days (× 365).

Example: You have lived approximately 12,410 days!

---

### ⭐ Q12. Tip & Split Calculator

Ask total bill, tip %, and number of people.  
Calculate tip amount and cost per person (2 decimals).

---

### ⭐ Q13. Circle Geometry Tool

Ask radius.  
Calculate:
Area = πr²  
Circumference = 2πr  
Show 2 decimal places.

---

### ⭐ Q14. Student Marks & Grade

Ask marks for 5 subjects (0–100).  
Compute:
Total = sum  
Percentage = (Total / 500) * 100  

Determine Grade:  
90-100: A  
80-89: B  
70-79: C  
60-69: D  
<60: F

---

### ⭐ Q15. Number Analyzer

Ask for any number and determine:
- Positive / Negative / Zero  
- Even / Odd  
- Square of number
